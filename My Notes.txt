A DATA QUERY LANGUAGE AND RUNTIME - Official Definition

Something that you put between client and server. When client needs data from two or more services then building a GraphQL layer is important. Becuase in that way the client donot need to know all the apis. The only api the client will see is the graphql api.

graphql is a data agent. 

Strong typed
Graph based structure
Declarative

Regular APIs overfetch information that they don't necessarily need. By querying graphql api you can pull whatever information you need. When a graphql query is executed it returns a json object where every key in the answer matches the request query.


Language:-
  Query       
  Mutation    
  Subscription 
  Fragments
  
 Runtime:-
  Validation
  Type System
  Introspection
  Execution
  
To describe both queries and mutations we can use the generic term Operation. A graphql operation is a simple string with optional variables
variable: {body: "Great"}
variables make the query reusable for diffrent inputs.
 
The graphql operations are written in documents on the client site and then use an interface to send this documents to a graphql client server. Http is a popular interface   option /graphql ?query=.... &variables= ... 
http is one of the options. you can use sockets, ssh, cli etc. graphql doesn't have any preference on any communication protocol. graphql doesn't deport of http verbs or status codes like other apis.
 
a graphql document can contain more than one operations. In that case you need to tell graphql which operation to execute. 
/graphsql ? query=... &operatioName = ...
 
The graphql runtime translates the documents to a language that the data service can understand. The graphql runtime can be added to any existing data service or multiple data services. The data services will prepare the data and hand it to the graphql engine to send it back to the client.
The runtime layer can be written in any language. 

This approach decouples clients from the server and allows then to scale independently 

THE GRAPHQL SCHEMA
Every field in the schema has a type. It can be scalar or objects or array of objects. every field has a resolver function which can be mapped to its read logic.

What happens when a graphql request is made
  read input from an interface
  parse query into AST abstract syntax tree
  for every node in the tree the server invokes the resolver function. The resolver function can either return a scalar value or object or objects who have their own resolver function
  resolver functions for children nodes. It will be processed in the tree order
  ask data services
  data resolved from the resolver functions will be merged to a single object
  send response as json

LANGUAGE FEATURES  
  query TestQuery { --> selection set
    ctrl + space --> will list all the fields available
    
  
  
  }
  
  apaces, commas and new lines are all optional in a graphql query
  
  FIELDS
    can be scalar or complex. the complex fields are modeled after functions.  
  
  VARIABLES
    query getRocket($rocketId: ID!) {
    rocket(id: $rocketId ) {
      id
      name
      active
      boosters
      company
      cost_per_launch
      country
    }
  }

  {
  "rocketId": "falcon1"
  }
  
  DIRECTIVES
    @skip
    @include
    can be used on fields and fragments
    
    While testing on spacex playgound I got "Unknown directive \"@include\"."
    It was a version problem of the graphql-tools. Checking the node_modules/graphql-tools/package.json file I observed that I was using version 4. I found here that version 4       had problems with the directives and the use of version 5 was recommended. This is what I did:

    npm i graphql-tools@5.0.0
    I restarted the server and refresh the Playground page and voila, I already have the @include directive and all the others available.
  
  ALIASES
    use alias if client wants a different name than what returned from the server. Use alias on any field to customize its apprearance in the response.
    
    query getRocket($rocketId: ID!) {
      rocket (id: $rocketId ) {
      id 
      RocketName: name  
      active
      boosters
      company
      cost_per_launch
      country
      }
    }
    
    query getRocket($rocketId1: ID!, $rocketId2: ID!) {
      rocket1: rocket (id: $rocketId1 ) {
        id 
        RocketName: name  
        active
        boosters
        company
        cost_per_launch
        country
      },
      rocket2: rocket (id: $rocketId2 ) {
        id 
        RocketName: name  
        active
        boosters
        company
        cost_per_launch
        country
      }
    }

    variables
    {
      "rocketId1": "falcon1",
      "rocketId2": "falcon9"
    }

  FRAGMENTS
    it makes graphql composable and reusable. use the spread operator in the query. reusability is just one aspect of fragments. the real benefit is in composition.

    it can't be used on its own. the above query can be shortened like so.
    
    query getRocket($rocketId1: ID!, $rocketId2: ID!) {
      rocket1: rocket (id: $rocketId1 ) {
        ...RocketDesc
      },
      rocket2: rocket (id: $rocketId2 ) {
        ...RocketDesc
      }
    }

    fragment RocketDesc on Rocket {
        id 
        RocketName: name  
        active
        boosters
        company
        cost_per_launch
        country
    }
  
  INLINE FRAGMENTS
      query getRocket($rocketId1: ID!, $rocketId2: ID!) {
      rocket1: rocket (id: $rocketId1 ) {
        ...RocketDesc
        },
        rocket2: rocket (id: $rocketId2 ) {
          ...on Rocket {
          id 
          RocketName: name  
          active
          boosters
          company
          cost_per_launch
          country
           }
        }
      }
   
      this is useful when you query a fields with multiple types. in graphql you can query either an interface or a union of multiple types. Say a company has a Person type. The person can be either employee of vendor. So Person is an interface which implements employee and vendor. 
      similarly in GitHub let's say User can have authorised user who can commit and users who can view the code. It is represented by UNION in graphql. Let's assume the requirement is to show author details. 
      {
        github {
          repo(name:"graphql", ownerUsername: "facebook") {
            commits {
              message
              author {
                ... on GithubUser {
                  login
                }
                ... on GithubCommitAuthor {
                  email
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
   
  
  MUTATIONS
    update data
    
    mutation AddUser($usrObj: [users_insert_input!]!) {
      insert_users(objects: $usrObj) {
        affected_rows
        returning	{
          id
          name
          rocket
          timestamp
          twitter
        }
      }
    }
    
    query variables
    {
      "usrObj": {
        "id": "q23w423423wdwfwee",
        "name": "Shawn D",
        "rocket": "Falcon 10",
        "timestamp": "2021-07-06T09:31:35.330535+00:00",
        "twitter": "shawnd"
      }
    }
 
   initially got the error when I set variable type as "users_insert_input" without square brackets and exclamations
  "message": "Variable \"$usrObj\" of type \"users_insert_input\" used in position expecting type \"[users_insert_input!]!\".",
